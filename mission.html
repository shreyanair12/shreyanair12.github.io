<h1>Virtue Green</h1>
    
 <p> Our mission is to provide healthy foods that are farm-grown and contain the least amount of preservatives. We also make it our mission to give back to our planet, by having utensils and bowls that are eco-friendly. Our team understands that there arenâ€™t many restaurants that have vegan/vegetarian options, so we made it our mission at Virture Green to prioritize these foods. We wanted to take action when it comes to giving back to the environment, so after many hours of effort we created recipes that use healthy ingredients and eco-friendly choices. At Virtue Green, we prioritize your health and our planet! </p>
